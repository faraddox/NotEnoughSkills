# NotEnoughSkills
Currently WIP (early stage) mod for Minecraft, adding skills system.
Every player have several skill groups, such as "Mining", "Farming", "Battle" etc.
Every skill group can be leveled by player actions (Example: A little xp for rock, and more xp for ores in Mining skills.)
Player will obtain skill points for leveling group and use them to get skills from this group.
Go and kill mobs and you will be stronger.
Go and travel around the world and you will be faster.
Work hard on your farm and you will get more food.
Mine, mine, mine and you will get more ores (twice more, or even may be thrice?).
Do it, level up it!
